i wanted to build a form wrapper npm package with vue.js, but turns out i didn't got time to.

this is a small project i intent to finish someday, which i built mainly to learn vue.js and break my react.js monogamy.

### stack and dependencies:

- tailwindcss w/ postcss
- typescript
- vite
- vue.js
