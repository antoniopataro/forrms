#### About
I wanted to build a form wrapper npm package with Vue.js, but turns out I didn't got time to invest on it.

Therefore, this is a small project I intend to finish someday, which was built mainly to help me learn Vue.js and break my previous React monogamy.

#### Tech
- tailwindcss w/ postcss;
- typescript;
- vite;
- vue.js.
